# B3T2

## What is B3T2?

B3T2, (name subject to change) is a fork of Blender that translate a 3D scene into a 2D dimentional scene in real time. Unlike existing shaders like cel, this engine will be comparable to hand-drawn and digital 2D animation, rather than flattening shaders to make an illusion of 2D, but can still easily tell that it's 3D.


here are mockup examples of the idea
